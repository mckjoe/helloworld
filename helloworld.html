<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>A Program to Greet the Planet...</h2>

<p>This page is an attempt to greet everybody on earth using our various human languages.  We are interested to see how long the list is able to become.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples that I know off of the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>English: Hello, world!</li>
  <li>Spanish:  Hola, mundo!</li>
  <li>Japanese:  Konnichiwa, sekai!</li>
  <li>French:  Bonjour, munde!</li>
  <li>Kinyarwanda:  Mwirwe, isi!</li>
</ul>
